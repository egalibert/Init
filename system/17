ssh -p 2222 elliot@127.0.0.1 

# I used this connect the virtual machine to Iterm

# I also needed to change from VirtualBox settings-> Network the port configuration
# to 2222 and 22, 

# In VM settings->network change NAT to bridge adapter and start the system
# 		since, NAT machine doesnot have IP address on the external networks so,
# 		bridge networking connects the VM to a network using the network adapter on the host system.
# first, install openssh-server using sudo apt-get install openssh-server ii
# then, start the service using sudo service ssh start
# then, get the IP address of the Debian system in VM using hostname -I i.e, 10.11.199.31
# To connect via ssh on the VM use the following commands in Terminal, ssh user@IPaddress
