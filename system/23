# Graphic session: After launching VM and you see the login manager
#	Just enter username and password

# SSH Session:
#   In VM settings->network change NAT to bridge adapter and start the system
#       since, NAT machine doesnot have IP address on the external networks so,
#       bridge networking connects the VM to a network using the network adapter on the host system.
#   first, install openssh-server using sudo apt-get install openssh-server 
#   then, start the service using sudo service ssh start
#   then, get the IP address of the Debian system in VM using hostname -I i.e, 10.11.199.31
#   To connect via ssh on the VM use the following commands in Terminal, ssh user@IPaddress
#		for example ssh egaliber@10.0.2.15 and then password

# I also needed to change from VirtualBox settings-> Network the port configuration
# to 2222 and 22
