sudo pkill -9 <process_name>

# pkill only stops it 
# You can also use 'sudo pkill -9 PID' if you know the PID, this is to target specific
# Also I have had some weird behaviour and sometimes it just stops or teminates it
# This answer seemed to always kill it
# kill -9 `jobs -l | grep 'tail -f ' | awk '{print $2}'`
